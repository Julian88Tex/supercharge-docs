It might take a while for the codespace to open. A lot of times it's because extensions have to be loaded, so keep an eye out for the clock icon as well as small popups, which you can safely ignore.

## Take a Look Around

First, it might not look like your current installation of Visual Studio Code. The theme might be different, the font sizes might be larger. 

You might also notice some extra extensions have been loaded. If you look carefully at the terminal prompt, it's been modified to be shorter.

### Exercises

1. Look for the `settings.json` file in the `.vscode` folder.
1. Click to open the file and take a peek at a sample settings file.
