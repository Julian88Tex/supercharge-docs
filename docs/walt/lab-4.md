### Explore the VS Code extensions

VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. Each codespace starts with a set of predefined extensions.These are defined by the codespace owner and defined in a configuration file. 

This is a nice advantage for students, as we can ensure that all the tools  they need to get started are available.

You'll see how to customize this list of extensions later in the workshop!

### Let's look
