### Open the terminal

ðŸ’¡ **Instructor tip:**

>Visual Studio Code includes a full featured integrated terminal that conveniently starts at the root of your workspace. The integrated terminal can use various shells installed on the Codespace VM. **Bash** is the default, but there are others like **PowerShell**.


### Steps

The command line terminal (bash) is docked to the bottom of the editor. 

If you do not see it press **Ctrl+Shift+\`** [PC] or **âŒ˜+Shift+`** [Mac]
 
Note the custom command prompt `Universe-Workshop>`, this is specified in the configuration files.
