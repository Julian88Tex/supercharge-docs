## Explore VS Code

You are looking at the **Visual Studio Code** application running in the cloud, accessible via your browser. It's also possible to create a Codespace and use the Visual Studio Desktop application (on your PC or Mac) to connect to Codespace. The default option is to use the browser however.

With Codespaces, you can work on most devices, as long as it has a modern browser.  We've tested it on iPads and Android tablets, so yes you can work on your projects from anywhere. 

### Familiar to VS Code users

The browser version of VS Code is similar to the desktop version. Which is a plus for your employees or students that know VS Code. The main differences between the two is the menu location. Check out the hamburger menu in the upper left of the application.

### The Activity Bar

The Activity Bar is docked along the left side of the editor.  Here you'll find buttons for showing various windows (Explorer, Search, Source Control, Debug, Extensions, Settings etc.). In this lab section we'll look the Explorer, Source Control and Extensions tools.

The blue circles with numbers are notifications from the associated tool.  For example the number 3 in the screenshot indicates there are three files that haven't been committed to source control yet.
