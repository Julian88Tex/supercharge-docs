## Explore VS Code

You are looking at the **Visual Studio Code** application running in the cloud, accessible via your browser. It's also possible to create a Codespace and use the Visual Studio Desktop application (on your PC or Mac). The default option is to use the browser however.

With Codespaces, you can work on most devices, as long as it has a modern browser.  We've tested it on iPads and Android tablets, so yes you can work on your projects from anywhere. 

### Familiar to VS Code users

The browser version of VS Code is similar to the desktop version. Which is a plus for your employees or students that know VS Code. The main differences are the menu location. Check out the hamburger menu in the upper left of the application.
