## Fork the lab repositories

Committing code changes while editing within a Codespace is the same as when editing code in a local repository. The changes are stored locally, within the Codespace. Syncing and pushing the changes back to the GitHub hosted repo is the same too. 

Note: Syncing is only allowed to a repo that you own. In the GitHub world, this is accomplished by forking the repository

In the labs you'll work with three repositories that we've created.  To save changes to these repos, you'll need to fork them first.

ðŸ’¡ **Instructor tip:**

>Instructors create a repository for the training. The learners use the repository. That way they can see the example files and edit them to match the instruction. Having the students fork the training repo allows them to save changes as they progress through the training.

### Fork 
1. Open a new browser tab.
2. Navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/octocloudlabs/supercharge-canvas-fun" target="_blank">animation repository</a>.
3. Fork the Repository
4. Open another browser tab
5. Fork the <a href="https://github.com/octocloudlabs/supercharge-linkedin-course" target="_blank">LinkedIn Learning repository</a>.
6. Open another browser tab
7. Fork the <a href="https://github.com/octocloudlabs/supercharge-customize" target="_blank">supercharge-customize</a>.

Keep the browser tabs open, as you'll be returning to the three forks during the labs.
