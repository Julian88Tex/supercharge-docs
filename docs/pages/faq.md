GitHub is a Microsoft-owned company that offers a complete software development platform to build, scale, and deliver secure software. GitHub Codespaces provides a real-world development environment (sandbox) that mirrors software development in the workplace, thereby helping accelerate technical skill acquisition through realistic hands-on practice. Because Codespaces is cloud-based (no local machine setup), it allows for speed, security, and learning on any machine. GitHub is used by over 83M developers around the globe and over 90% of Fortune 100 companies.


### Why should I use GitHub Codespaces?
* Get hands-on practice with GitHub Codespaces, a professional, enterprise-grade tool that you’re likely to encounter in the workplace, making your skill acquisition more directly and easily applicable to your day-to-day work. 
* Spend less time on local set-up and more time learning and practicing with GitHub Codespaces’ cloud-based, isolated in-browser development environment that allows for risk-free learning on any machine in seconds. 

### What advantages does GitHub Codespaces offer over using my local machine?
* GitHub’s cloud-based virtual environment allows learners to access their code anytime from anywhere. Local setup and installs are not required to utilize LinkedIn Learning Codespace-enabled courses, eliminating the need for security clearance on enterprise machines. 

### Do I have to pay for Codespaces? 
* You have access to 60 free hours monthly of GitHub Codespaces per month. 

### What happens if I run out of hours? 
* The 60 hours, 2 core allotment of free time on Codespaces renews monthly. You can either choose to wait for your hours to refresh the following month, or choose to pay for more time via your GitHub Codespaces account. 

### Can I invite someone else to work on this Codespace with me?
* Yes. Visual Studio Code offers a Live Share extension to support real time collaborative team programming. Live Share isn’t installed by default in a new codespace, but it can be installed by anyone for free. After installing the extension and restarting the codespace, the codespace owner becomes a Live Share host and can send a link to anyone with either read-write or read-only access. 

### Is GitHub Codespaces only available in courses for software developers?
* GitHub Codespaces is available to all learners. Codespace-enabled courses are available for major programming languages (Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript, Rust, Go, and PHP) as well as courses in Data Science and AI and Machine Learning. 

* There are three different practice types for beginner to advanced learners: Hands-On Introduction, Practice It, and Level Up course. These are designed from the ground up to mirror Bloom’s taxonomy and optimize hands-on learning as we introduce, apply, and create through these unique courses. 

### Will all tech courses be integrated with GitHub Codespaces?
* No. LinkedIn Learning courses cover a variety of tech skills and topics, not all of which are relevant for using GitHub Codespaces. However, even if a course doesn’t have a specific codespace configured, learners can use GitHub Codespaces to practice. In addition, LinkedIn Learning offers multiple methods of practice, including 
### What other practice methods do you offer?
* Challenge/solutions courses which multiple challenges to practice your coding skills at increasing levels of difficulty

* Downloadable follow-along source code (exercise files and GitHub Repos) to easily follow along with instructor, practice, and experiment on your local machine. 
* Challenge solution videos that include structured real-world scenario challenges.
