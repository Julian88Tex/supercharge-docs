## Following the Course

For this workshop we've selected three movies from the middle of the example course. This is to showcase how GitHub branches can be used to progress the learner through a staged project and allow them to drop in and out of the course at any stage and still start with the same code as the instructor.

## How to follow along

1. Find the first movie of the third chapter, titled "Create Authenticator."
2. Use the built-in Git tool or terminal commands to checkout branch `03_01b` ("b" for "beginning").
3. Play the movie and follow the instructions, coding along in Codespaces.
4. Optional: When you reach the end of the movie, you can compare your code to the code in branch `03_01e` ("e" for "end").
5. Stash your changes or commit them to either the `03_01b` branch or a new branch using the built-in Git tool or terminal commands.
6. Find the next movie in the third chapter.
7. Checkout the branch for this movie: `03_02b`.
8. Repeat steps 3-8 for this movie and `03_02b`

## Background

ðŸ’¡ **Instructor tip:**

> * As you checkout each branch, note how the project has progressed to match where the instructor is in the course. This ensures the learner can always start at the same place as the instructor, no matter what movie they start with.
> * Because GitHub Codespaces is a VM, when you work with Git within Codespaces, you are working on a local Git tree on the VM, not on GitHub. That means you can safely stage, commit, checkout, switch, revert, rebase, and do anything you like without your changes affecting the repo. Your work as you make your way through the course is isolated to the Codespaces VM meaning only you can see it!
> * If you make a change you want to commit to the repo, you push it upstream to the GitHub repo just like you would push code from your computer to GitHub.
