## Following the Course

For this workshop we've selected three movies from the middle of the example course. This is to showcase how GitHub branches can be used to progress the learner through a staged project and allow them to drop in and out of the course at any stage and still start with the same code as the instructor.

## How to follow along

1. Find the first movie of the third chapter, titled "Create Authenticator."
2. Use the built-in Git tool or terminal commands to checkout branch `03_01b` ("b" for "beginning").
3. Play the movie and follow the instructions, coding along in Codespaces.
4. Optional: When you reach the end of the movie, you can compare your code to the code in branch `03_01e` ("e" for "end").
5. Stash your changes or commit them to either the `03_01b` branch or a new branch using the built-in Git tool or terminal commands.
6. Find the next movie in the third chapter.
7. Checkout the branch for this movie: `03_02b`.
8. Repeat steps 3-8 for this movie and `03_02b`

## Background

ðŸ’¡ **Instructor tip:**

> * As the learner checks out each branch, note how the project has progressed to match where the instructor is in the course. This ensures the learner can always start at the same place as the instructor, no matter what movie they start with.
> * Because GitHub Codespaces is a VM, when the learner uses Git within Codespaces, the learner is on a local Git tree on the VM, not on GitHub. That means the learner can safely stage, commit, checkout, switch, revert, rebase without your changes affecting the repo. All work in the course is isolated to the Codespaces VM meaning only the student can see it!
> * If the learner makes a change they want to commit to the repo, they push it upstream to the GitHub repo just like they would push code from their computer to GitHub.
