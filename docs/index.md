## Welcome
Get ready for the hands-on labs in the **Supercharge your onboarding and developer training with GitHub Codespaces** workshop. 

*Our contention is that using Codespaces means you'll spend less time on local set-up which gives your employees and students more time learning and practicing. Plus it is cloud-based, isolated in-browser development environment that allows for risk-free learning on any machine in seconds.*

This workshop is divided into three sections.

1. Creating and managing Codespaces
2. Explore how LinkedIn Learning uses Codespaces in video training
3. Customize Codespaces for your team

### Creating and managing Codespaces

In this section you'll create a codespace.  We'll use animation open-source repository as the basis for our studies.

You'll learn how to:

* Create a Codespace
* Restart an existing Codespace
* Manage existing Codespaces
* See the Visual Studio enhancements (extensions and UI)
* See the Command Line Interface customizations
  

###	Explore how LinkedIn Learning uses Codespaces in video training

LinkedIn Learning knows a lot about creating video training content. We have over 18,000 courses, including an extensive tech library. In the last six months we've been busy exploring Codespaces and formalizing how to integrate them into our tech courses. In this section you'll explore our **Hands-On Introduction to Java** course. You'll get to see how the instructor seamlessly works with the exercise examples in the course repository. Then we'll talk about the lessons we've learned.

You'll learn how to:

* Topic 1
* Topic 2

### Customize Codespaces for your team

Using a Codespace is simple, at least it is from the learners perspective. To create this idyllic and seamless experience requires preparation however. 
Someone needs to customize and configure the codespace.

You'll learn how to:

* Choose as pre-defined Docker template
* Configure the Docker container
* Add Extensions to Visual Studio Code
* Customize the command prompt
* Create a Code Tour
